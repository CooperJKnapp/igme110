                    <p class="text-content">
                            In a study of different game design classes, researchers from Penn State found that classes built upon 
                            modding rather than building games from the ground up resulted in students better understanding game 
                            design concepts such as balance, design, and space. They found that by using modding in their curriculum, 
                            educators were able to help students better visualize and apply concepts discussed in class. Additionally,
                            freelance modding is beneficial in learning game design as well. Many modders tell stories of landing jobs 
                            at the companies that made the games being modded.

                    <p class="text-content">
                            In a study of the effect of video game modding communities on sales, University of Haifaâ€™s Leo Poretski and 
                            Ofer Arazy discovered that games with communities oriented toward modding tended to sell more copies and last 
                            longer in a statistically significant manner. They also found that developers who actively attempted to nurture 
                            these communities, for example by creating developer and creation kits for their games, tended to outperform 
                            even the other games with healthy modding communities as well. For example, they found that Portal 2, a puzzle 
                            game created by Valve, had its player base multiply 20 fold after the release of its creation tools. Same with 
                            Minecraft, still boasting a massive player base and modding community 10 years after release.
