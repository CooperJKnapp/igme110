            Monkeys are the animals that are closest to humans out there. Humans have similar DNA to monkeys, and scientists predict that humans and monkeys share similar ancestors.
            Monkeys can use their tails with the same amount of dexterity as their arms, so they can use them to grab branches and swing around. It's almost as if they have 5 arms!
