            Cheetahs are fast land animals. They are the fastest land animal. They can reach speeds up to 112km/h. They are carnivores and spend much of their free time hunting.
            Because of the effort they spend running so fast, they need to spend a lot of time at the watering hole cooling off. Cheetahs are native to Africa and are found
            manily in the savannah.

            - With a narrow waist and slim body, cheetah’s body is covered by several black-circled spots that measure 2 – 3 cm (0.79 – 1.2 inches). <br/>
            - These cats are capable to reach a speed of 100 km (62 miles) within just 3 seconds; however, they can retain this much speed for a  short burst of time. <br/>
            - The weight of an adult cheetah is about 35 – 72 kg (77 – 160 lb). <br/>
            - Cheetah is 110 – 150 cm (43 – 59 inches) long excluding the length of tail which measures 60 – 84 cm (24 – 33 inches) in length. <br/>
