              <p class="text-content">
                Games modding is the act of going into a video game's code and modifying it to fundamentally change the game. 
                This includes anything from visual changes, to story, sound, and even gameplay changes. Many "modders" tend 
                to publish their works online for players to download. The heart of modding is to not only fix broken games, 
                but to also enhance and boost the longevity of people's favorite titles.

              <h2 class="title">Why support modding?</h2>
              <p class="text-content">
                  Modding is beneficial for the games community for many reasons. First, it allows people to experiment and 
                  learn game design principles, thus allowing them to join the industry. The creativity of these mods also 
                  tend to create entirely new genres as well, pushing the industry forward toward new ideas and games. And 
                  finally, it boosts the longevity and profits of already existing games.
